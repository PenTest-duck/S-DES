# Simplified DES (S-DES) Tool

This tool performs Simplified DES encryption & decryption, with multiple block support, and a step-by-step display of the process.

Usage:
1. Select e for encryption or d for decryption.
2. Enter your 10-bit key (you will then see the subkey generation process)
3. Enter your input in binary (please ensure your input length is a multiple of 8, i.e. your input consists of bytes)
4. Watch two S-DES rounds being applied to each of the blocks.
5. You will get your encrypted ciphertext / decrypted plaintext.
